Bash has been in the background of my beginner coding environment for sometime now, showing its head mostly when I’ve made a file mistake.  But what is Bash?  Lets start with a a broad overview and then break it down a bit. 

Bash is a UNIX shell environment that came to fruition in 1989 by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement of the Bourne Shell, Bash’s predecessor.  In fact, Bash stands for Bourne-Again Shell and they both have a lot of similarities with Bash having a few additional features.  Most users think of it as a command line interface but it can execute scripts as well.  Bash is the default shell for Mac OS and most Linux distributions.  

Ok great, but what is a shell?

In a nutshell (I couldn’t help myself), a shell is a way for the user of a computer to “speak” to the system.  The system can usually run without the user but a shell provides a way for the user to speak to the system when needed.  Operating system shells generally use either a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI).  A UNIX shell is both a command interpreter for the user to speak to the system and a programming language itself.  

Ok and what is this GNU Project you speak of?

GNU is a recursive acronym: “GNU’s Not Unix”.  Yeah, thats exactly what it stands for.  Announced in 1983, the GNU Project’s main goal was and still is to give users freedom of a user’s computer by collaboratively developing and providing software based on the users right to run the software, share it, study it and modify it.  In order to ensure that all software could be free, an operating system was created called GNU. Its design is UNIX like, but different by being free and containing no UNIX code. In 1992, in combination with Linux, the GNU/Linux operating system was released.  

For more information on Bash, I recommend reading up at this site [here](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide) which not only provides a beginner friendly introduction to Bash but also includes everything else you could ever possibly want to know about it.
