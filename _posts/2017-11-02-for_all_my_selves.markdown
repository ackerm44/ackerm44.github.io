My 15-year-old self would probably think it crazy.  Shouldn't I have had my thriving, handpicked career well underway by now?  Fifteen-year-old self had many, many things yet to learn and experience.  So, I'm not really taking on this new, challenging task of learning software development at the age of 30 for my 15-year-old self.  I'm doing this for my 31-year-old self. And 50-year-old self.  And 60 and 70-year-old selves who will appreciate the pivot I'm taking to change the course of my career.  

I had always been a good math and science student in high school.  My dream job was to work for NASA.  I would read Astronomy magazines from cover to cover each month.  I was given a big, beautiful telescope for my birthday one year.  Once I stepped foot on that giant campus of the University of Michigan however, I cowered.  There were so many students who were so much better at this stuff than me.  They weren't just peeking through a telescope and reading hobby magazines. They had been taking more advanced classes and taking everything much more serious for years.  So, I stepped back from it all that quick, thinking a STEM career couldn't be for me.  

Fast forward many years later and here I am.  After several years of a wavering career path and thinking that's just what it would have to be, I decided to just take one more moment to step back again.  This time however, I didn't step back to distance myself from what I thought impossible.  I stepped back to think about the possible.  About how I could actually take a step forward this time.  It was at this moment that the thought of myself as a software developer was born.  

Software development has come a long way since I started college.  I took a Visual Basic class in high school and really enjoyed it but that was it.  The teacher was uninspiring and I had no clue what a degree in computer science could look like.  Over the past few years, I've been learning from my brother the opportunities of learning software development but for some reason, never thought that it could apply to me. It wasn't until the 4th of July this year when I awoke early to just start to look around on the internet for a little crumb of direction.  And there it was: one of the many news articles regarding the tech boom.  I've always been a computer super-user and the office go-to person for computer fixes.  I learned to utilize and lightly edit some open source software for a point of sale system at my family's business.  I created word press blogs and custom websites and entered the world of HTML and CSS.  It was on this beautiful, summer morning when it hit me that the possibility of software development had really had been surrounding me all this time, just waiting for me to open to its first page.  

Since the 4th of July, I've been running full speed with my journey of learning software development.  I've listened to blogs ([CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org/) being a personal favorite), worked with the free online courses, picked up books and attended tech meet-ups.  The path of learning has been so invigorating that I wake up each day excited to face my challenges. 

I'm now dedicating myself fulltime to learning full stack web development online through Flatiron School and this is it.  This is where I've been meaning to get to for many years.  So, although my current self and my future self are thankful for the time I'm putting in now, I take back what I said earlier.  I believe my 15-year-old self would be quite proud as well.  And who knows, maybe that telescope and my new-found skills of programming just might align someday still.
