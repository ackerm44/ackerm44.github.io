Even building a simple application can be incredibly rewarding as a beginner.  

Utilizing the Sinatra DSL, I created an application that allows a user to create an account and track trails they have hiked.  Sinatra gives us plenty of built in functionality to be able to get up and running by simply requiring the Sinatra, ActiveRecord, Rake and sqlite3 gems.  In particular for this application, the Sinatra gem allowed me to route quickly by utilizing logic and view rendering. Having the built-in ActiveRecord associations for different models give us so many methods to quickly integrate with our tables. 

Here are some screenshots of the application:

I also utilized the Corneal gem to initialize the file structure.  Corneal is awesome! Not only did it allow me to easily create new controllers, models and views, but it also created a Gemfile with the most utilized gems, an environment file and a config.ru file. Lastly, a basic css styling file was included that I could easily play off of to give the application some flair.  

Using MVC (Models, Views, Controllers), the structure stays incredibly clean and allows for more and more complex applications to be built.  Building this application to track hikerâ€™s trails, I could really start to see what this app could potentially become one day with some effort.  

This project has allowed me to see a bigger picture of what everyday coding could potentially look like and if thats the case, I'm incredibly excited to see whats next to learn.
